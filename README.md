# testing-file-upload

This is code exploring file uploading using command line CURL and Node's [request module](https://github.com/request/request). It's related to this [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28245729/what-is-the-equivalent-of-curl-upload-file-in-node-request).

I'm basically just trying to figure out how to get Request to do the same thing as CURL.
